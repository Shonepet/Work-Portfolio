**Problem Statement**

Download a fraud detection dataset and perform the following 
•	Relevant data sources, methods, and tools for collection
•	Steps taken to clean and preprocess the collected data 
•	Transformations applied to the data, feature engineering (new features from the data)
•	Data combination from sources and compatibility (data integrity)
•	Data quality assessment (plus bias, ethics) 

Create a new Jupyter Notebook for the model development task.
• Develop a clear and logical step-by-step plan for implementing the model.
• Build and train the business analytics model using the data.
• Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.
• Organize and document your Jupyter Notebook neatly.

**Deployment Phase**

•	Deploy the ready model on a render.com

**Presentation Phase**

•	Develop a presentation with presenter notes. Combine information from the EDA & Modelling. 
•	Presents a clear, logical, and coherent line of argument. 
•	Demonstrates the ability to synthesize ideas and business analytics project findings. 
•	Provides a detailed and critical reflection in your analysis and discussion of the results. 
•	Critically evaluates current thinking in the discipline. 
•	Critically evaluates methodologies. 
•	Demonstrates the ability to formulate and test new ideas. 
•	Uses a variety of effective methods, measurements, and techniques of analysis. 
•	Demonstrates the ability to present opinions and model results from findings in a well-structured and convincing way. 
•	Demonstrates the ability to plan, execute, deploy, and monitor a business analytics project with at least some element of originality. 

Data Source

The original case study was on PayPal.com. Due to unavailability of real dataset online as a result of privacy concerns and other ethical considerations, Paysim Synthentic Dataset was used for this project as it mimics PayPal mobile transactions
Data was sourced from kaggle.com
